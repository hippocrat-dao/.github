# Welcome to Hippo Protocol

Hippo Protocol is a Cooperative Protocol for Healthcare Data Collection & Utilization powered by the interchain stack: [CometBFT](https://cometbft.com), [CosmosSDK](https://docs.cosmos.network) and [IBC](https://ibc.cosmos.network). The primary token of Hippo Protocol is the **HP**.

## The HP

Do you have HP tokens? With HP, you have the superpower to contribute to the security and governance of the Hippo Protocol. Delegate your HP to one or more of the validators on the Hippo Protocol blockchain to earn more HP through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your HP to influence the future of the Hippo Protocol through on-chain governance proposals.

Learn more about [being a delegator](https://docs.hippoprotocol.ai/main/delegators/delegator-faq), learn about [the security risks](https://docs.hippoprotocol.ai/main/delegators/delegator-security), and start participating with one of the following wallets.

## Hippo Protocol Wallets

Do your own research and take precautions in regards to wallet security. Maintaining proper security practices is solely your responsibility when using third party wallets.

These community-maintained web and mobile wallets allow you to store & transfer HP, delegate HP to validators, and vote on on-chain governance proposals. Note that we do not endorse any of the wallets, they are listed for your convenience.
